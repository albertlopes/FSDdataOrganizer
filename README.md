FSDdataOrganizer
================

Tool to organize the game data from Free Style Dash 2/3 for Xbox 360;


ABOUT THE APP
-------------
I made this app to organize better the data of the the Freestyle Dash.(if your games are alphabeticaly ordered).

The idea is simple, when you add a game on FSD is created a index to the data of the game, and when start loading the art from the games (cover and background) the FSD follows that index.

The problem: this index is not organized alphabetically. it makes the game load the covers for the date you added, this means that if you add a game today started with the letter 'A' he will be the last to display the information, but the first in the game list.

Solution. This app recreates the indexes alphabetically and grouped by type (XBLA, Classic xbox, xbox360, Apps, Emulators).
This makes the loading of the covers better for those who use the games in alphabetical order.
